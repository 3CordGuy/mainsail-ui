[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is used for local development of components in an isolated environment.

- Create React App is used solely for the setup of Storybook.
- At compile time, CRA is not used and a custom rollup config is used.

## Installing Locally For Development

1. Clone the repo
1. `cd mainsail-ui`
1. `yarn install`

## Developing ðŸ”¨

When working on Mainsail, you can run Storybook locally:
#### Requirements

- Node 12+

#### Run Storybook

```
yarn storybook
```

### Scaffold Your Files ðŸŽ‰

When developing components, it can be time-consuming and cumbersome to try to mimic current project conventions.

We have taken the guesswork out of this and included built-in generators to help you scaffold the proper related component files in their respective locations. This eliminates boilerplate grunt work.

Behind the scenes this uses the fantastic [Plopjs](https://plopjs.com/).

To generate boilerplate and work on a new component:

```
yarn scaffold component
```

This will prompt you to answer some questions and generate the necessary working files for you.

The structure will look like this:

```src
â”œâ”€ assets
â”œâ”€ components
|  â”œâ”€ Button
|  |  â”œâ”€ Button.js
|  |  â”œâ”€ Button.scss
|  |  â”œâ”€ Button.stories.js
|  |  â”œâ”€ Button.test.js
|  |  â””â”€ index.js
```

## Installing (to a project)

Install the npm package just like any other.

```
npm install @breezechms/mainsail-ui

// or

yarn add @breezechms/mainsail-ui
```

Then import and use your desired component:

```js
import { Button } from "@breezechms/mainsail-ui";

<Button text="Do Stuff" />
```
